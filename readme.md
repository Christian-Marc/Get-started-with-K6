# Getting started with K6 load testing

To learn K6 load test tooling an IDE is needed, a project and exercises. During the exercises you will discover how K6 works and how you can use it to put an application under load. The whole goal of load testing is to analyse the behavior of an application under load. 

The getting started consists of the following steps:
- Install an IDE of your preference, see 
  - https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/misc/integrations/

- Create your first K6 project, see
  - Cloning a Github project: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
  - Cloning a template project (vanilla plain project): https://github.com/tom-miseur/k6-templates
  - Cloning a second project (project of the Readme file): https://github.com/Christian-Marc/Get-started-with-K6
    - example solutions to the K6-learn exercises
  - Perform K6-learn assignments, see https://github.com/grafana/k6-learn
